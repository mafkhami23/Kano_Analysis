# Kano Analysis Model for Real Estate Development
![Kano 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fef7aa5-0b87-4ef2-b09e-d84dadc5a654)


Understanding customer needs and preferences is crucial for real estate developers aiming to create competitive, high-performing properties. This project implements a Kano analysis model to systematically prioritize features based on customer satisfaction and expectation levels.
By analyzing user responses, this model helps identify which features require immediate attention to improve performance and which can be prioritized for future development. This ensures that development efforts are focused on the most impactful aspects before introducing new features.
How the Kano Model Works
The Kano Model categorizes customer reactions into five distinct types, helping developers align their offerings with user expectations:
- Must-have (Basic Features);Essential features that users expect. Their absence leads to dissatisfaction, but their presence doesnâ€™t necessarily increase satisfaction.
- Performance (One-dimensional Features); Features that directly impact user satisfaction; the better they are implemented, the happier users become.
- Attractive (Delighters); Unexpected features that pleasantly surprise users and significantly boost satisfaction when present.
- Indifferent; Features that have little to no impact on user satisfaction.
- Reverse; Features that some users may dislike or prefer not to have.</br>

## Why Use This Model?
Prioritize feature development based on real customer insights.
Improve decision-making by distinguishing between critical needs and optional enhancements.
Optimize resources by focusing on high-impact improvements before adding new features.
Enhance customer experience by aligning development with user expectations.
This tool provides real estate developers with a data-driven approach to product and service design, ensuring that investments align with market demands and maximize customer satisfaction.
A sense of how your features are perceived in terms of usefulness and functionality as well as how urgently these features are needed using the importance factor



## Code Features
- **Data Cleaning**:
- The script includes data cleaning steps, such as setting column headers, removing unwanted rows, and preparing the dataset for further analysis.

### **Kano Model Analysis:**
- The script implements the Kano model, which is used to classify customer preferences into categories (e.g., must-haves, performance attributes, and delighters) to understand and prioritize product features based on their impact on satisfaction.

### **Kano Model Survey Data Processing**:

This script processes survey data to classify responses into **Kano categories** based on the relationship between **expectations and satisfaction**. The logic behind the classification allows for insights into customer preferences by evaluating how different features impact user experience.

### **Features of the Script**:
- **Kano Classification:** Categorizes responses into **Must-Have, Performance, Attractive, Indifferent, and Reverse** based on survey data.
- **Grouping Variables:** Allows segmentation based on factors such as:
  - **Location**
  - **Age Group**
  - **Other demographic or behavioral factors** (if applicable)
- **Data Processing Logic:**
  - Analyzes responses comparing **expectations vs. satisfaction**.
  - Identifies trends in user preferences.
  - Helps in decision-making for feature prioritization.

This script provides a **structured approach to Kano Analysis**, helping teams understand what features users value the most and guiding **product development strategies**.

### **Kano Graphic Generation**:
- Using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn, the script generates Kano graphics, which visually represent the relationship between product features and customer satisfaction.
