# 🏙️ Kano Analysis Model for Real Estate Development

![Kano Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fef7aa5-0b87-4ef2-b09e-d84dadc5a654)

Understanding customer needs and preferences is essential for developers aiming to create competitive, high-performing real estate. This project applies the **Kano Model** to prioritize features based on their impact on **user satisfaction and expectations**.

By analyzing survey responses, this approach helps identify:
- Features that are essential (Must-Haves)
- Features that boost satisfaction (Performance & Attractive)
- Features with little or negative value (Indifferent or Reverse)

## 💡 What is the Kano Model?

The **Kano Model** classifies features into five categories:

| Category      | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Must-Have** | Basic expectations. Their absence causes dissatisfaction, but their presence doesn’t increase satisfaction. |
| **Performance** | The better these are, the happier users are. |
| **Attractive (Delighters)** | Unexpected features that pleasantly surprise users. |
| **Indifferent** | Features with little or no effect on satisfaction. |
| **Reverse** | Features some users actively dislike. |
